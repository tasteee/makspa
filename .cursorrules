We are using THRELTE + SVELTE v5.
THAT MEANS we use RUNES like $state, $props, $effect, $derived, etc.
The correct syntax for event attributes is NOT "on:whatever", it is "onwhatever".
Do NOT destructure props, or objects, or anything. Always use dot notation to get values.
Write CLEAN, COMPOSIBLE, FUNCTIONAL, EXPLICIT CODE.

Use SVELTE 5 with RUNES like $state, $props, $effect, $derived, etc.
Use SVELTE 5 with RUNES like $state, $props, $effect, $derived, etc.
BE SURE TO USE THE CORRECT SYNTAX AND NOT SVELTE 4 SYNTAX.
